        <h1>Brief: Parallel 03</h1>
        <div>I was contracted to help with this project by Vancouver New Music, an organization promoting
            new musical works based in Vancouver. The idea was to explore a
            fully-remote collaborative process and produce an interactive online experience, as well as an album.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>Raven Chacon (now Pulitzer prize-winning composer) and John Dieterich (of the fantastic
            group Deerhoof, among many other projects) led the collaboration from a musical perspective. Also involved
            were various instrumentalists, writers, and visual artists. Read more

        <div class="img-outer"><img src="./images/vnm_sketch2.jpg" alt="Initial sketches of the UI" /></div>
        <em class="caption">Sketches of the project idea</em>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I led the group through a few sessions of brainstorming and whiteboarding, in order to get a better idea
                of the goals and expectations. The leaders of the project and I also met a few times to touch base and
                get onto the same page.</li>
            <li>Other than that, all collaboration was asynchronous - I sent sketches and ideas out to the participants
                to discuss
                and iterate on. They sent me their writings, audio clips, and images, and we slowly reached a consensus
                of how all this was going to look.</li>
            <li>The group wanted it to be something that would
                encourage experimentation, and be somewhat chaotic and inscrutable, yet mesmerizing.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="img-outer"><img src="./images/vnm_shot.png" alt="UI Elements acting crazy" /></div>
        <em class="caption">Creative use of UI Elements</em>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This project was a blast for me because everyone was so intensely creative - the kinds of people that I
                feel an affinity for, having a background in art and music. I learned that one of my core skills is
                straddling that line between imaginative creativity and more technical engineering concerns, and
                communicating between people in both camps.
            </li>
            <li>Through the collaborative process, I realized that the end product was going to be quite different from
                most of the websites and web development I'd worked on previously.</li>
            <li>
            <li>Designing this experience was interesting because no one had a set idea of the end product beforehand.
                Instead, the group had a lot of ideas for how the experience would make someone feel, what the
                sensations would be, and I worked backwards from that to the final idea.</li>
            <li> I came up with the idea of a big, opaque "wall" of controls - each control actually affecting some
                parameter of the audio - for example, pitch, or filter frequency. The controls would pop in and out,
                changing over time.</li>
            </li>
            <li>The geometric animal shapes were an asset we knew we wanted to be central. Each one represents a
                different "room" of sound - with different audio clips, effects,
                and different types of controls available. The user gets an impression that they're blindly navigating
                through a labyrinth of strange rooms.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="theme-webaudio">Web Audio</h3>
        <div class="img-outer"><img src="./images/vnm_tonecode.png" alt="Tone JS" /></div>
        <em class="caption">The incredible Tone JS library</em>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>For audio processing, I used the incredible Tone JS library. It has a rich set of features for effects,
                synthesis, and playback.</li>
            <li>The library allows you set up everything as a
                network of nodes, with audio flowing through them, effects or transformations being applied in each
                node.</li>
            <li>As a UI control first renders, it is assigned to a random parameter of an effect that's in the current
                space, which is handled within a React Hook by a custom pub/sub system that I wrote.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="theme-aws">Amazon Web Services</h3>
        <div class="img-outer"><img src="./images/vnm_aws.png" alt="AWS services" /></div>
        <em class="caption">The AWS services used on this project</em>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I opted to use Amazon Web Services for the infrastructure and hosting of the project. Admittedly there
                wasn't much going on on the backend, so "infrastructure" is a pompous word, but I wanted to use this
                project to learn more about AWS.</li>
            <li>The static build files all live in S3, and I used CloudFront as the CDN and Route 53 to set up the dns
                routing.
            </li>
            <li>The biggest hurdle of using AWS was understanding how permissions and roles work - I would constantly
                run into problems where I had unknowingly left something inaccessible, or where a service didn't have
                the proper permissions. I still haven't mastered this but I appreciate the idea that everything is
                locked down by default, and permissions must be explicitly given for a very specific context.</li>
        </ul>
