    <p class="explain">This is a maze generator using something fancy called a
      Union-Find algorithm. To see it run, just press the "AMAZE" button, sit back, and wait for... a maze. 
      The individual cells are joined into a 'forest' of larger 
      and larger trees, until they're all one giant tree which means every 
      cell can be reached by every other cell. When a cell changes color, that means it's been joined up with 
      another tree of cells. Note: the tree structure of a Union-Find algorithm doesn't mean that
      the physical cells of this maze are connected in a tree structure; it's just how the bookkeeping of
      "what's connected to what" takes place in the background. A good application of this algorithm could be to determine
      who is connected to who through different friends on a social media site.
